Still having a great time retaking 201.  I feel very prepared going into project week, and hope I can add a lot of value to my team.  I have a really great group of people to work with, so it should be a fun project.

Local storage was a concept that totally passed me by in my first iteration of 201.  I am so happy I am able to learn it with a better base this time.  Can be so useful when needed.
