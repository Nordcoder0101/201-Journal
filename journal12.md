Had a good day of doing assignments yesterday.  I really enjoyed the article yesterday on how Google built their culture.  I have never seen such 'soft' concepts be displayed with data.  Cool to be able to confirm what I consider common sense with actual data.

Had a bit of a challenge getting my data to sync with a chart, but am close enough that I feel with a bit more time I'll have it displaying no problem.

Things are still going well, looking forward to project week.
