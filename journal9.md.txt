Journal 9

I made it an easy day for me yesterday.  My brain was not very functional after a lack of sleep and going so hard on the
JavaScript.  Admittedly I am not a big fan of the design side of coding, but will keep chugging along to make my site
pretty enough.

Feeling super good about everything right now, be be able to get JS to work without a ton of help is an amazing and 
encouraging thing.
