Journal 11

I was able to get most of the assignment done.  I got all the user stories written and a thoroughly wrote out my problem domain.  I have identified all the functions I need to write, but ended up passing out at my keyboard while writing the functions and stayed asleep until 3AM.  

Will be able to wrap up the rest of the functionality without too much issue.

As far as my process, this was the most confident I have been able to attack with a full plan and understanding of what I want to accomplish before I even started coding the project.
